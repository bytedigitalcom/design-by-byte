# Design By Byte

Hi dear Developer,

This repository exists to supply necessary code to add this signature to your website's footer:

Designed by $\textcolor{#0969da}{Byte}$ with $\textcolor{#0969da}{Shopify}$

## How to Use

1. Add this script to the `<head>` section of your website:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Byte-Dijital/design-by-byte@latest/design-by-byte.js"></script>
   ```

2. Add the `design-by-byte` class to the div where you want the signature to appear:

   ```html
   <div class="design-by-byte"></div>
   ```

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
